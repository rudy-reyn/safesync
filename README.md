# safesync.io

This is an end-to-end encrypted file syncing application
with the client written in Python and the backend Haskell.

Originally, wanted to use Haskell for both the client application
and the backend, but decided to use python for the client instead
as I found it to be simpler and more well suited for an application
based on file monitoring and manipulation.
